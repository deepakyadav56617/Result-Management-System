## Project-Introduction

   * Existing-System
   ```
   The manual method of students’ academic result processing was found to be tedious,
   especially when carried out for a large number of students, this makes the entire process
   time-consuming and error prone.
   
   A existing system has following disadvantages:
   
➢ In the manual system students need to bear a lot of time and cost.

➢ Compiling the result in the manual system is a tedious process.

➢ Lack of transparency in the present system.

➢ In the existing system, students have no proper idea of marks in different
   assessments for their self-evaluation. Learning from mistakes is the best way
   for the growth of a student.
   
➢ Existing System creates more pressure on the examination board of the college.
